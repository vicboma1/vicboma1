Hi!! I am Victor Bolinches, as known as **vicboma1** ðŸ¤ 
After a long time, I decide to **open my mind** and **contributing my knowledge** to the local community to help everyone.

The **sponsorship program** can be used to **improve my last project** , [Loader Dumps Arcade Emulator ](https://github.com/vicboma1/loaderDumpsArcade) **and my researches** about IT software solutions with Kotlin, Java, C/C++ and .NET

Would you be interested in collaborating with me ?  ðŸ˜Š 
**Together we will learn more about how to improve our way of doing things !** ðŸ˜‰
Rock & Roll ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜
